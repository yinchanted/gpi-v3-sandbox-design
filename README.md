# gpi-v3-sandbox-design
Design solution for gpi v3 dynamic sandbox.

For all dynamic responses, LAU response headers will be handled by the api gateway, thus out of scope in the discussion below. The following is only for the design of the response bodies. :shipit:

* [/payments/status](payments-status.md)

* [/payments/{uetr}/transactions](payments-uetr-transactions.md)

* [/payments/changed/transactions](payments-changed-transactions.md)

* [/payments/cancellation](payments-cancellation.md)

* [/payments/cancellation/status](payments-cancellation-status.md)

* [/payments/events/invalid](payments-events-invalid.md)
